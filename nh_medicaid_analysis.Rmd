# Medicaid Match Descriptive Statistics 


## Table 1. Data Check: Unique Individuals and Bookings in Administrative Jail Data versus Medicaid Jail Data

Note: With Medicaid data, the count of unique individuals in each jail will not add up to the statewide total as some individuals were booked at multiple jails. Thus, they appear in multiple individual jail counts, but only once in the statewide count. For this reason, it is probably best to only compare differences in unique individuals at the jail-level.

## Table 3. Percentage of Individuals/Bookings with Medicaid Match and Behavioral Health "Encounters": by timing of BH Encounter

Note: "Encounters" include any behavioral health-related medical/clinical or pharmacy visitation. Examples include ED visits or pharmacy services linked to mental health or substance use disorder diagnoses. We should probably ask Uma for a DHHS definition for the presentation. 

**The following table is split out by timing of behavioral health Medicaid encounter: before, during, or after the study period. See logic below**

Pre-study period: Medicaid eligibility end date < 7/1/2018

Study period: Medicaid eligibility end date >= 7/1/2018 & Medicaid eligibility start date <= 6/30/2021

Post-study period: Medicaid eligibility start date > 6/30/2021 (b/c this was a very small sample, I have only presented pre- and study-window counts and percentages)

## Table 4. Percentage of High Utilizer Individuals with Medicaid Match and Behavioral Health "Encounters"

Note: "Encounters" include any behavioral health-related medical/clinical or pharmacy visitation. Examples include ED visits or pharmacy services linked to mental health or substance use disorder diagnoses. We should probably ask Uma for a DHHS definition for the presentation. I am currently using all behavioral health data from the Medicaid Encounter file, regardless of timing (before, during, or after the study period)

Grouping of individuals into 'high utilizer' percentile groups is based on statewide data, using the Medicaid match files from DHHS, as opposed to county-level data. In other words 

```{r echo=FALSE,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
### to recode high utlizer percentile grouping, we don't need to group_by as the percentile grouping is already grouped across individual from Mari's cleaning

## Table 5. Percentage of Individuals/Bookings who were Experiencing Homelessness at time of Medicaid Eligibility

Note: Since we only have homelessness data for individuals who matched to Medicaid enrollment data, our denominator for these metrics will be the sample of individuals who have at least one Medicaid enrollment during the study window (i.e., individuals who did not match to Medicaid data are excluded here). Because of this decision as well as the fact that the DHHS data notes whether an individual was experiencing homelessness at the beginning of a given Medicaid enrollment period. In other words, we wouldn't know if someone had housing at the beginning of enrollment and then experienced homelessness afterwards). I am currently using all homelessness data from the Medicaid Enrollment files, regardless of timing (before, during, or after the study period). 

**Because of these factors, we should all discuss how we understand and explain this measure. At the very least, we probably want to acknowledge that this is likely an under count**

## Table 7. Percentage of Individuals with Behavioral Health "Encounters" by Treatment, Service, and Programming Type

Note: "Encounters" include any behavioral health-related medical/clinical or pharmacy visitation. Examples include ED visits or pharmacy services linked to mental health or substance use disorder diagnoses. We should probably ask Uma for a DHHS definition for the presentation. For this analysis, encounter type is broken down into mental health, substance use disorder, whether service is affiliated with CMHC provider (Community Mental Health Centers), emergency department visit, pharmacy service for mental health, pharmacy service for substance use disorder, as well as other services. 

**For this analysis, we are only including BH-encounters that occurred during the study window (Medicaid eligibility end date >= 7/1/2018 & Medicaid eligibility start date <= 6/30/2021)**

**For definitions of each column/flag created in the analytic file, see full data dictionary here: https://csgorg.sharepoint.com/:x:/s/Team-JC-Research/EUJfEABIuNNBvKARa4Kq1nwBvSLwsK4aH7K9oZDOWxbc1w?e=JADcH8**

* Slide 38: A closer look at serious SPMI's (bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, etc.) 

* Slide 40: HU's ____% more likely to have an opioid use disorder

* Slide 43: From 2019 to 2021, service providers were reimbursed X% less than the national average.From 2019 to 2021, service providers were reimbursed an average of $X per claim.

* Is Medicaid enrollment starting again when people are released from jail?
