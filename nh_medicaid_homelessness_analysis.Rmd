# DHHS Medicaid Match and Jail Booking Descriptive Analysis: Individuals Experiencing Homelessness

<br>

## Tables


### Table 1. Percentage of Individuals/Bookings who were Experiencing Homelessness at time of Medicaid Eligibility

Note: Since we only have homelessness data for individuals who matched to Medicaid enrollment data, our denominator for these metrics will be the sample of individuals who have at least one Medicaid enrollment during the study window (i.e., individuals who did not match to Medicaid data are excluded here). Because of this decision as well as the fact that the DHHS data notes whether an individual was experiencing homelessness at the beginning of a given Medicaid enrollment period. In other words, we wouldn't know if someone had housing at the beginning of enrollment and then experienced homelessness afterwards). I am currently using all homelessness data from the Medicaid Enrollment files, regardless of timing (before, during, or after the study period). 

**Because of these factors, we should all discuss how we understand and explain this measure. At the very least, we probably want to acknowledge that this is likely an under count**

### Table 3. Percentage of High Utilizer Individuals/Bookings who were Experiencing Homelessness at time of Medicaid Eligibility

Note: Since we only have homelessness data for individuals who matched to Medicaid enrollment data, our denominator for these metrics will be the sample of individuals who have at least one Medicaid enrollment during the study window (i.e., individuals who did not match to Medicaid data are excluded here). Because of this decision as well as the fact that the DHHS data notes whether an individual was experiencing homelessness at the beginning of a given Medicaid enrollment period. In other words, we wouldn't know if someone had housing at the beginning of enrollment and then experienced homelessness afterwards). I am currently using all homelessness data from the Medicaid Enrollment files, regardless of timing (before, during, or after the study period). 

**Because of these factors, we should all discuss how we understand and explain this measure. At the very least, we probably want to acknowledge that this is likely an under count** 

**Statistics for individuals who are high utilizers of jail are based on the top 10% percentile of statewide bookings.**
