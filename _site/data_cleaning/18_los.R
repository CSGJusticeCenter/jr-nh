# LOS

# What was the average length of incarceration in jail?
#
# Statistics: First, break up into PC vs. criminal charge admissions
# Then, calculate the minimum, mean, median, and maximum jails stays
#
# Graphic: show distribution (density plot?), with vertical lines for average
# (we can use median is the data are skewed, or mean if theyâ€™re somewhat normally distributed)
#
# I wonder if we could potentially have a global distribution density plot,
# but then have 9 lines showing the average for each county as a visual to compare across counties.
# This is a low priority though.
