# Ignore warning messages.

# Note about LOS: some people can be booked on the same day for multiple charges.
# For example, someone could enter jail on a protective custody hold on 10/19 with a release
#   date of 10/20 but also be booked for a criminal charge on 10/19 with a release date of 10/26
#   For this reason, find the maximum release date for each booking id (created using id and booking_date).
