The following incarceration patterns were found using jail administrative data submitted to DHHS, which was then de-identified and sent to CSG. This data gives a more accurate picture of the number of people entering NH jails from FY2019 to FY2021 due to movements between jails.

# Entrances

**Includes**: People booked into jail for a criminal charge ("bookings") and protective custody (PC) holds.   
**Counties**: All New Hampshire counties except Grafton. Includes Coos bookings, but not their PC holds because Coos removed PC hold data from their system.   

### People Entered  

```{r, results='asis'}
# total number of people entered (no duplicates for counting by FY)
amt_people_entered <- entrances_dhhs %>%
  dplyr::summarise(total = n_distinct(id)) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(label = formatC(total, format="d", big.mark=","))
amt_people_entered <- amt_people_entered$total

# count number of people entered for all three years / accounts for double counting by FY-accurate
amt_people_entered <- format(round(as.numeric(amt_people_entered), 0), nsmall=0, big.mark=",")

# print header for pc hold section
cat("**There were ", amt_people_entered, " people who entered NH jails between FY2019 to FY2021.**\n\n", sep = "")

### Number of Entrances  

Please Note: This section reflects the number of entrances per fiscal year, not the number of people.

**On average, people entered jails 1.8 times from 2019 to 2021.**

### AB NOTE: similar to the averages calculated in the 'nh_high_utilizers_analysis' file, I wonder if we should calculate a separate county-level 'num_entrances' measure (where we group by id and county) for when we calculate means? similarly, though, i guess the alternative interpretation is just that we're saying an individual booked in x county had 10 bookings, even if not all 10 occurred in that county? let me know what you think!

### here's some possible code to create a separate measure of the number of entrances per person per county
### i think we could use this measure for all county-level averages of entrances 
### and then use num_entrances for all individual-level analysis 
entrances_dhhs_per_person_county <- entrances_dhhs %>% 
  group_by(id,county) %>% 
  mutate(num_entrances_per_county = n_distinct(booking_id, na.rm=TRUE)) %>% 
  ungroup()

### AB NOTE: as an example, i went ahead and swapped out the dataframes and variables for the following county-level calculation

# Average number of entrances/fy by county
df_avg_entrances_county <- entrances_dhhs_per_person_county %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  select(county, id, num_entrances_per_county) %>%
  distinct() %>%
  group_by(county) %>%
  dplyr::summarize(avg_entrances = mean(num_entrances_per_county, na.rm=TRUE)) %>%
  mutate(county = case_when(county == "Coos" ~ "Coos (bookings only)", TRUE ~ county))

### AB NOTE: I think it's okay to leave this measure as individual-level, not county-level, but we
### might want to note that the state average will be higher as it counts entrances across all jails

# average number of entrances/fy by state
df_avg_entrances_total <- entrances_dhhs %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  select(id, num_entrances) %>%
  distinct() %>%

# Average Daily Population

# Costs

The average cost per person per year was calculated by dividing each county department of correction's 2021 budget by the average daily jail population in that county. This method was used when a cost wasn't provided by the jail. All jails submitted costs except for Belknap, Carroll, and Hillsborough (as of 3/9/23).
