Welcome to the JRI New Hampshire project website. This is a private, password protected website that should not be shared externally. Use the navigation in the top right corner to view county reports and other analyses.

FOR INTERNAL CSG JC USE ONLY.

**Project Purpose:** 

This project will focus on the prevalence of people with behavioral health needs moving through local county jails and the availability and impact of existing services and supports for this population statewide.  

Goal 1: Improve criminal justice and public health outcomes for people with behavioral health conditions who are high utilizers of the health and jail systems.  

Goal 2: Reduce gaps in the state’s data systems and information sharing capacity by working with agencies and staff to build data collection and analysis capacities.   

Matching data from all 10 counties’ jails with data from the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) would distinguish New Hampshire as the first state in the country to conduct a statewide jail to Medicaid data analysis.
