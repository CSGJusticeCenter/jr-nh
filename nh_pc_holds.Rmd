### How Protective Custody Holds Are Recorded

Each county records PC holds differently. PC holds are recorded in the charge description, booking type, sentence status, or release type, and sometimes across these metrics. See each **County Report** in the top menu to see how each county records PC holds and the "outcomes" of these holds.
